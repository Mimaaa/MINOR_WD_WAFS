        <h1>NERD</h1>
        <p>As a kid, I was always fascinated and surrounded by electronics. A Philips cassette player was among my first toys. I would take things apart to see how they worked, like how the tape winds itself around the heads in my dad's reel-to-reel recorder. I didn't necessarily know how to put everything back together though. I borrowed children's electronics books from the library and experimented with my own circuits.</p>
        <p>My dad used to work with electronic music research and instrument building, so there was no shortage of parts at home. This is when I had my first wonderful trips into parts stores as well. My mom, a carpenter, was also a source of DIY mentality at home.</p>
        <p>Among my favorite books were Kuinka kaikki toimii (How Stuff Works) and Keksijän käsikirja (Science Fun).</p>
        <p>Signals came into play a little later. Our family used to spend summers at our summer place that had a radio with a shortwave band. Of course, the band was full of beeps and boops that I was eager to find an explanation for – a perfect way to spend rainy days. Eventually the sunny days, too. Pranking truck drivers with illegal Russian walkie-talkies was among those activites as well.</p>
        <p>(All this happened to also coincide with me seeing the movie Contact.)</p>
        <p>As a teenager I saved up for my own SW radio and started listening to numbers stations and other mysterious signals. That's how I also got interested in government intelligence, SIGINT, TEMPEST, laser microphones, and all that neat shady stuff.</p>
        <p>This wasn't a popular children's hobby where I lived, and coupled with my social awkwardness it didn't bring me too many friends. But it didn't really matter.</p>
        <p>Getting my Windows machine 'hacked' got me thinking about encryption, skript kiddies, tinfoil hats, and Linux.</p>
        <p>As a 10-year-old, I had started programming with Max (pictured), a visual programming language that I used for making simple text adventures and blinkenlights. Max was a Macintosh program intended for realtime music and signals programming, but it happened to be quite accessible for children to play with. I even borrowed one of the Usborne children's BASIC game books from the library and tried translating the code listings into visual Max diagrams, which worked to some extent.</p>
        <p>Later we got our first PC and I'd learn QuickBasic, which I soon s///'d with Perl, after someone caught me writing CGI web pages with it. (Yeah, QB CGI, it's possible.) I still use Perl for quick scripting and prototyping.</p>
        <p>An electronics class in eighth grade taught me the basics of soldering and DIY PCB manufacturing.</p>
        <p>I went to a science high school, majoring in physics. In college I took some classes in computer science, but wasn't extremely enthusiastic about it; my major was in biosciences, though I never graduated. New signals needed decoding, and I studied digital signal processing for fun at home. Worked as a coder at the same time.</p>
        <p>During the past couple of years I've learnt there's a scene full of hackers like us, and they're quite a funny bunch.</p>
