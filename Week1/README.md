# Reflection Week 1

It was a long time ago since I've worked with JavaScript and I wasn't good at it either, to be honest. That made it tough for me to get started.

I struggled the most with knowing when to apply certain kind of code. To express myself in simpler terms: when I want to make a table in HTML I know which elements I need to combine to construct the table. In JavaScript it's still to abstract for me to reach the same goal.

I didn't want to bother anyone, but I found out that people didn't mind helping me out when I needed the help, which I appreciated a lot. Pierre helped me a lot by guiding me through the process which made me understand the code that was expected much better.

To increase my knowledge of JavaScript I've started with the exercises on FreeCodeCamp.com, but Luuk gave me a link to a tutorial that is respected by many (www.javascript30.com) and which helped him learn a lot about JS. I'm going to follow that course as well, to make sure I have a much better understanding of JavaScript.
